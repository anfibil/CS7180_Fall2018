# CS7180 - Special Topics in AI | _Fall 2018_

This repository contains supporting material to the Special Topics in AI course being taught in the Fall 2018 at the Seattle campus.  For the most part, the material you will find here is made up of Jupyter Notebooks that will be covered in class, and that illustrate Python implementations of some of the concepts we will discuss. These files will also serve as reference for some homework assignments.
